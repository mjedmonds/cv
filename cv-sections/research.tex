{Causal Transfer Learning}
{Los Angeles, CA}
{Sep 2017 – Present}
{
\begin{cvitems}
\item Examining how causal knowledge can be incorporated into reinforcement learning to enable better knowledge transfer across task and environment domains.
\item Matched human causal learning performance by decomposing causal representations into two Bayesian components: a bottom-up associative learning scheme and a top-down structure learning scheme.
\item Studied how humans perform in causal transfer tasks and compared performance against state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms.
\end{cvitems}

{Fostering Human Trust through Explainable AI (XAI)}
{Los Angeles, CA}
{Jan 2019 – Present}
{
\begin{cvitems}
% \item Investigating the form of explanations that foster human trust and the computational models that support such explanations.
\item Developing a computational model to generate explanations for robot behavior based on theory-of-mind (ToM) in a communicative learning setting.
\item Fostered trust between robots and humans in an imitation learning setting by providing sequential, action-level explanations to human subjects. This work built off of my work on imitation learning using tactile feedback.

{Transferrable Representation Learning using Language Supervision}
{Los Angeles, CA}
{Jun 2019 – Present}
{
\begin{cvitems}
\item Developing a photorealistic virtual environment (based on Unreal Engine) that provides semantic language labels for objects and actions occurring in the virtual agent's field of view.
\item Examining the role of language in building generalizable, commonsense representations of the environment.
% \item This work is inspired by research in child development and aims to build commonsense knowledge from interaction.

{Imitation Learning using Tactile Feedback}
{Los Angeles, CA}
{Sep 2015 – Sep 2017}
{
\begin{cvitems}
\item Transferred visually latent causal changes from a human demonstrator to a robot using a tactile glove, an And-Or graph, and neural networks.
\item Utilized a manipulation policy that encodes long-term temporal constraints using an And-Or graph and leverages haptic feedback from human demonstrators to incorporate real-time sensor data.
\item Deployed robot localization on a ROS-based Baxter robot combining SLAM (using RGB-D and LIDAR), wheel odometry, and IMU data through Kalman filtering.

{Declarative Memory Acceleration}
{Dayton, OH}
{May 2014 – Sep 2015}
{
\begin{cvitems}
\item Accelerated the declarative memory module of AFRL's CECEP cognitive architecture (based on \href{http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/}{ACT-R}) by leveraging the parallelization of CUDA, yielding a 100x speedup over the fastest existing implementation.
